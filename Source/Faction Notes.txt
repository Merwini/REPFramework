Tribal - buildings are rounded to give a more primative feel, chaotic layout
    Tribal Coalition Seat - Effect: use better PawnKinds (more berserkers, more heavy archers, more chiefs). Map: tribal village around a large central building
    Psychoid Fields? - Effect: gives raiders Yayo.
    Trading Post - Effect: gives raiders gunsmithing-tier guns (assume trading with industrials)
    Animal Pens - Effect: gives raiders combat animals (wargs, bears, boars, etc.)
    Flame Arrow camp? - Effect: "artillery siege" but it's just one large barrage of flame arrows before raid

    Aristocrat's Enclave - Effect: send more nobles with psycasts
    Mechsignal Spoofing Station? - Effect: send one or more mechanoid raids before the Empire raid?
