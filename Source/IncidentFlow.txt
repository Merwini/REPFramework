Storyteller selects IncidentDef to add to incident queue
Instantiates an IncidentParms
Storyteller calls TryFire on the queuedIncident
	has a tick timer, if it fires or fails to fire before the timer hits 0, it is removed from the queue
TryFire calls the IncidentWorker.CanFireNow and IncidentWorker.TryExecute, if both return true, incident is considered fired
CanFireNow is mainly for checking game state against conditions set in the IncidentDef, should not be overriden, calls CanFireNowSub as its final check
	CanFireNowSub is a better place to put custom logic
TryExecute checks if the incident requires pawns on the map and, if so, that pawns are present on that map. Then calls TryExecuteWorker
	TryExecuteWorker is where you should put custom logic

Default raid TryExecuteWorker:
	Calls TryGenerateRaidInfo(IncidentParms parms, out List<Pawn> pawns, bool debugTest = false)
		Clears pawns list
		Calls ResolveRaidPoints
			makes sure that parms.points is greater than 0
		Calls TryResolveRaidFaction !!! NEED TO OVERRIDE
			if the parms already has a faction set, early return (for if player forces raid from specific faction via debug tool)
			Tries to select a random faction for the raid, weighted against whichever faction raided last, and has to have a PawnGroupMaker that matches the PawnGroupKind (i.e. Combat)
			If that fails, tries again but with flag desperate which makes it ignore earliestRaidDays in the factionDef (e.g. for mechanoids)
		Calls ResolveRaidStrategy !!! NEED TO OVERRIDE
			checks if the raidStrategy of the parms is legal with the faction (for if specific raidStrategy has been called by debug)
			If not legal/not set, tries to select a random RaidStrategyDef from the database, weighted based on faction settings
				if it fails to select one, sets to ImmediateAttack
		Calls ResolveRaidArriveMode !!! NEED TO OVERRIDE
			checks if raidArrivalMode of the parms already is set
			checks if the raid is an ally sending immediate aid, in which case selects edge or center drop
			checks if raid strategy is null, in which case sets it to immediateAttack
			tries to select a random arriveMode for the selected strategy, sets to edgeWalkin as fallback
		Calls ResolveRaidAgeRestriction
			not important
